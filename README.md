Introduction:

Welcome to the repository for the paper "Unlocking the Power of Knowledge Graphs: Advanced Reasoning and Embedding Techniques" by Otmane Azeroual and Renaud Fabre. This paper explores the latest advancements in reasoning and embedding techniques for Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and demonstrates how these technologies can enhance the semantic depth and utility of KGs for various applications.

Paper Overview:

1. Reasoning Algorithms: These algorithms infer implicit knowledge from explicitly stated facts within a KG. The paper covers two primary approaches: Rule-Based Reasoning and Constraint-Based Reasoning. Both methods are detailed with mathematical formulations, pseudocode, and example implementations.

2.Embedding Algorithms: These algorithms represent entities and relations in dense vector spaces, capturing their semantic meanings. The paper discusses two key approaches: TransE (Translation-Based Embedding) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Both techniques are presented with theoretical explanations, mathematical formulations, pseudocode, and practical examples.

Purpose of the Repository: This repository provides the code corresponding to the appendix of the paper. It includes mathematical formulations, pseudocode, and example implementations of the various reasoning and embedding algorithms discussed in the paper. The provided code examples aim to help researchers, data scientists, and developers understand and implement the algorithms presented in the paper.
